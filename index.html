            Hi! This is an informational article to instruct beginner web developers on

                Note: This article only covers the bare minimum for creating a working website from HTML. For more
                advanced websites, <a href="https://hackr.io/blog/web-development-frameworks">here is an article by

        <h1>Step 1: Create a GitHub Account</h1>
        <p>
            GitHub is a free platform owned by Microsoft designed for developers to
            build, manage, and deliver software to the public. For more information, visit their <a
                href="https://github.com/about">about page</a>.

            <br />
            <br />
            Click the GitHub button below to go to the home page and sign up.
            If you already have a GitHub account, you can sign in instead.
        </p>

        <a href="https://github.com">
            <img class="image github"
                src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1075896042316365884/GitHub-Emblem.png">

        <h1>Step 2: Create a Code Repository in GitHub</h1>
        <p>
            A repository is an archive of the code in your project you are working on.
            It allows you to easily update your code and view the history of changes.

            <br />
            <br />
            Once you have signed into the GitHub dashboard, click the green "New" button to create a repository:
        </p>

        <img class="image create-repository"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1075540989567053954/Screenshot_2023-02-15_at_2.14.57_PM.png">

        <p>
            Then fill out the following prompt with your info:
        <ul>
            <li>Repository name - most likely the title of your website</li>
            <li>Description - optional, if you want to provide a description of your website</li>
            <li><strong>Must select the "Public" option</strong> - otherwise your website can't be hosted publicly</li>
            <li>Finally, scroll down and click "Create repository"</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <img class="image repo-info"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1076028849692872805/Screenshot_2023-02-16_at_10.29.13_PM.png">

        <h1>Step 3: Initialize the Repository With a New File</h1>
        <p>
            The next part is a little less intuitive. You need to create the first file for your repository,
            which is done by clicking the blue link "creating a new file", as highlighted below:
        </p>
        <img class="image init-repo"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1076032271313805332/Screenshot_2023-02-16_at_10.47.29_PM.png">

        <p>
            This will bring up a form where you can edit your new file. First give the file a name, for your website
            <strong>it must be "index.html"</strong>.
            Your index.html file is the entry file to your website, and will contain the code to render the first page
            that users see.
        </p>
        <img class="image indexhtml"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1076034270067425330/Screenshot_2023-02-16_at_10.55.15_PM.png">

        <h1>Step 4: Start Writing HTML Code</h1>
        <p>
            Now it's time to start coding!

            Your first line should be this:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
            &#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;
            &#60;html&#62;&#60;/html&#62;
            &#60;p&#62;foo bar&#60;/p&#62;
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This tag simply specifies that the document type is HTML.
        </p>
