            Hi! Have you ever wanted to create your own website? A real website, where you control everything
            and can do whatever you want, and aren't limited by only the tools available on
            website-building platforms like Google Sites, and you get to learn
            how to write basic code?
            You've come to the right place.
            This is an informational article to instruct beginner web developers on
            creating their first website from
            scratch, and how to use GitHub to host it publicly.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <p class="note-text">
                Note: This article only covers the bare minimum for creating a working website from HTML. If you're
                looking to build a more
                advanced website using more advanced software engineering techniques, that is out of the scope of this
                article.
                However, <a href="https://hackr.io/blog/web-development-frameworks">here's an article by hackr.io</a>
                on the best frameworks for building modern web applications!

        <h1>Step 1: Create a GitHub Account</h1>
        <p>
            GitHub is a free platform owned by Microsoft designed to help developers
            build, manage, and deliver software to the public. For more information, visit <a
                href="https://github.com/about">their about page</a>.

            <br />
            <br />
            Click the GitHub button below to go to the home page and sign up.
            If you already have a GitHub account, you can sign in instead.
        </p>

        <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">

        <h1>Step 2: Create a Code Repository on GitHub</h1>
        <p>
            A repository is an archive of the code in your project you are working on.
            It allows you to easily update your code and view a history of the changes you've made.

            <br />
            <br />
            Once you have signed into the GitHub dashboard, click the green "New" button to create a repository:
        </p>

        <img class="image create-repository"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1075540989567053954/Screenshot_2023-02-15_at_2.14.57_PM.png">

        <p>
            Then fill out the following prompt with your info:
        <ol>
            <li>Repository name - most likely the title of your website</li>
            <li>Description - optional, if you want to provide a description of your website</li>
            <li><strong>Must select the "Public" option</strong> - otherwise your website can't be hosted publicly</li>
            <li>Finally, scroll down and click "Create repository"</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <img class="image repo-info"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1076028849692872805/Screenshot_2023-02-16_at_10.29.13_PM.png">

        <h1>Step 3: Initialize the Repository With a New File</h1>
        <p>
            The next part is a little less intuitive. You need to create the first file for your repository,
            which is done by clicking the blue link "creating a new file", as highlighted below:
        </p>
        <img class="image init-repo"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1076032271313805332/Screenshot_2023-02-16_at_10.47.29_PM.png">

        <p>
            This will bring up a form where you can edit your new file. First give the file a name, for your website
            <strong>it must be "index.html"</strong>.
            Your index.html file is the entry file to your website, and will contain the code to render the first page
            that users see.
        </p>
        <img class="image indexhtml"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1076034270067425330/Screenshot_2023-02-16_at_10.55.15_PM.png">

        <h1>Step 4: HTML Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Now it's time to start coding! Here's a very basic introduction to HTML:

        <ul>
            <li>
                HTML is composed of "elements". Here are the steps to follow to create an element:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make an opening tag.
                    <br />
                    The opening tag is composed of a less than sign (&#60;),
                    the element name, and a greater than sign (&#62;).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Type the text you want the element to show on the web page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make a closing tag.
                    <br />
                    The closing tag is the same as the opening tag,
                    with the same element name, but with a backslash
                    in front.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The following example defines a "title" element with text "hello world":
                    <br />
                    &#60;title&#62;hello world&#60;/title&#62;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                The HTML page should start with this tag to specify that the document type is HTML:

                <pre class="inline"><code>&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</code></pre>

                This is a special element and does not require a closing tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, your entire web page should be surrounded by an "html" tag. It's just the top-level
                element for an HTML page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Within the html tag you should have a "head" element and a "body" element.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The head element will contain information about your page that the browser uses.
                        For example, a "title" element within the head will define the title of your website that is
                        displayed on the tabs of your browser.
                        You can also add the icon that the browser displays on the tab, next to the title.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The body element is the most important.
                        It will contain all of the rest of the code you write to render
                        text, images, and more on the website.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Step 5: Start Writing HTML!</h1>
        <p>
            With the above steps in mind, here's what your index.html file should look like
            with its most basic HTML structure (you can just copy and paste this code
            into the text area of the index.html file you're creating).
            Also notice the indents before each nested element.
            It's very good practice to format your code with indents to make it more readable.
        </p>
        <pre><code>&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;

&#60;html&#62;
    &#60;head&#62;
    &#60;/head&#62;

    &#60;body&#62;
    &#60;/body&#62;
&#60;/html&#62;</code></pre>

        <p>
            Now, add a "title" element within the head tag, and an "h1" and a "p" within the body tag.
            "h1" stands for header 1 and will render a bold header with larger font size,
            while "p" stands for paragraph and will render smaller sized text.
            You can make the text within the elements whatever you want!
        </p>

        <pre><code>&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;

&#60;html&#62;
    &#60;head&#62;
        &#60;title&#62;
            A Cool Website
        &#60;/title&#62;
    &#60;/head&#62;

    &#60;body&#62;
        &#60;h1&#62;My Home Page&#60;/h1&#62;

        &#60;p&#62;Hello world!&#60;/p&#62;
    &#60;/body&#62;
&#60;/html&#62;</code></pre>

        <p>
            The above code will render a website that looks like this (notice the name of the tab at the top!):
        </p>

        <img class="image website-render" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077364582676443196/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.02.00_PM.png">
    
        <h1>Step 6: Publish Your Website on GitHub!</h1>
        
        <p>
            Once you've finished with the code you're putting in your index.html file,
            scroll to the bottom and click the green "Commit new file" button.
        </p>

        <img class="image commit-file" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077366567890853949/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.09.29_PM.png">

        <p>
            The file will be added to your project. Next click on the "Settings" tab of your repository:
        </p>

        <img class="image settings-button" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077367487986941982/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.13.18_PM.png">

        <p>Then scroll down the settings page and click on the "Pages" tab:</p>

        <img class="image pages-tab" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077367854208389201/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.14.46_PM.png">

        <p>
            The next step is to deploy your code with GitHub Pages, which is the service
            that GitHub provides for people to publish their code. First, under the
            section that says "Branch", click on the button that currently says "None"
            (it says that because nothing is currently being published).
            This will bring up a dropdown, and then select the "Main" branch, which is
            simply the code that you just added in your index.html file.
        </p>

        <img class="image select-branch" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077368853195128862/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.18.16_PM.png">

        <p>
            Then click the "Save" button that will appear (ignore the button that says "/ (root)").
        </p>

        <img class="image save-branch" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077369557544620112/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.21.33_PM.png">

        <p>
            Now, it will take a few minutes for your website to deploy, and it will say
            "Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the main branch."
            <br /><br />
            Reload after a few minutes, and this is what it should look like once your site is deployed:
        </p>

        <img class="image site-live" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077371179972702208/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.27.45_PM.png">

        <p>
            Click on the link to your website, and you're done!
            Here's what the website might look like, but this time, notice the URL:
        </p>

        <img class="image website-render-public" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1075539648346062879/1077371880069148762/Screenshot_2023-02-20_at_3.30.47_PM.png">

        <p>
            You can now share this URL with anybody, and they'll be able to view your website as well!
        </p>

        <h1>More Information</h1>

        <h3>Updating Your Website</h3>

        <p>
            If you'd like to update your website, you can simply return to the main
            code tab of your repository, click on your "index.html" file,
            and then click the button with a pencil on it at the top of the file.
            This will allow you to edit your code. Once finished, click on
            the green "Commit changes" button at the bottom, and in a few minutes your
            live website will be updated!
        </p>

        <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>

        <p>
            Web development has become more and more relevant in recent years
            as a result of peoples' increasing dependence on technology and the Internet,
            so it is a useful skill to know how to build your own website
            no matter what job you have, as paying another organization to host your website
            for you can be very expensive.
            <br /><br />
            Some things you do with your own website:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Share cooking recipes</li>
            <li>Create a blog</li>
            <li>Make an "about me" website for others to read about you</li>
            <li>Create informational articles to help others or spread awareness about a topic</li>
            <li>Create websites for your friends and family, so they don't need to pay for hosting fees either</li>
            <li>If you're interested in making a career out of web development, it is generally a high paying job</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>

        <p>
            According to <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/web-developer/salaries">indeed.com</a>,
            web developers (people who write the code for the front-end of websites, the part that the public sees)
            have an average annual salary of $80,434. Developers with 10 or more years
            of experience in the field have an average salary of $102,267.
            So if this is an activity you love, you could easily make a living from it!

            <br /><br />

            Futhermore, web development is one way to get into the general field of
            software engineering, which also contains many other jobs you might be interested in.

            <br /><br />
            Here are some related jobs and their average salaries, according to both
